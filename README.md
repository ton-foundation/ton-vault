Simple cold storage of ton keys with flexible backup options.

## Installation and upgrade

Download pre-build binaries from [releases page](https://github.com/ton-foundation/ton-vault/releases/latest). To upgrade you can just download binary and upload it to your cold storage machine.

## Getting started

1) Copy binary to a folder that would be your vault and run it. Preferably on computer without network hadrware.
2) App will ask you about creating a new vault or importing one. You can import any valid mnemonics that generated by any wallet or other vault.
3) If needed backup mnemonics by using `Backup vault` menu
4) Create your first key in `Key management` section
5) Deploy wallet with `Deploy` command in `Transfers` section and follow instructions

Now you have a master key, first cold wallet and ability to generate any number of new wallets and new vaults.

## What to backup

We recommend to create a one master key and backup it on paper/metal and then create child vault from this key and keep it on your offline machine for all your other wallets and vaults. You can create any number of child vaults and keep them separate to avoid compromising everything at once.

## How it works

TON Vault is based on idea that for every given valid mnemonics is is possible to create any number of new unique mnemonics from a single existing one. This allows you to create any number of accounts without needing to backup everything but main key and greadly simplifies things and improves security.

Since you can create new mnemonics from existing one than you can create a new vault from generated one to form a tree of keys that all could be gradually backed up using different strategies.
